# Overview

This is a Telegram message forwarding automation system built entirely with Telethon, featuring a Telegram bot interface for managing forwarding tasks and a userbot service for automatic message forwarding between Telegram chats. The system provides a complete Arabic-language bot interface with phone number authentication and multi-threaded service architecture. **Status: Fully operational and tested (August 8, 2025).**

## Recent Changes
- **August 8, 2025 (Latest)**: Successfully completed word filter system repair and optimization:
  - **FIXED**: Critical KeyError in task data access - replaced `task[1]` with `task['task_name']`
  - **OPTIMIZED**: Database word filter checking methods to eliminate inefficient individual queries
  - **ENHANCED**: Word filter data structure to include case sensitivity without separate DB calls
  - **IMPLEMENTED**: Comprehensive error handling for all callback button parsing with detailed logging
  - **INTEGRATED**: Word filter system successfully with UserBot for real-time message filtering
  - **RESOLVED**: All callback parsing issues causing "error 1" in button handlers
  - **VERIFIED**: System running successfully with 4 active forwarding tasks and clean logs
  - **COMPLETED**: All word filter buttons now functioning correctly (add words, view words, clear filter)
